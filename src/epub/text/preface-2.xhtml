			<h2 epub:type="title">Preface to the Second and Third Editions</h2>
			<p>In publishing a Second Edition (1875) of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Dialogues</i> of Plato in English, I had to acknowledge the assistance of several friends: of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G. G.</abbr> Bradley, Master of University College, now Dean of Westminster, who sent me some valuable remarks on the “Phaedo”; of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Greenhill, who had again revised a portion of the “Timaeus”; of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R. L.</abbr> Nettleship, Fellow and Tutor of Balliol College, to whom I was indebted for an excellent criticism of the “Parmenides”; and, above all, of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr> Professor Campbell of <abbr>St.</abbr> Andrews, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Paravicini, late Student of Christ Church and Tutor of Balliol College, with whom I had read over the greater part of the translation. I was also indebted to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Evelyn Abbott, Fellow and Tutor of Balliol College, for a complete and accurate index.</p>
			<p>In this, the Third Edition, I am under very great obligations to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Matthew Knight, who has not only favoured me with valuable suggestions throughout the work, but has largely extended the Index (from 61 to 175 pages) and translated the “Eryxias” and “Second Alcibiades”; and to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Frank Fletcher, of Balliol College, my Secretary. I am also considerably indebted to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. W.</abbr> Mackail, late Fellow of Balliol College, who read over the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i> in the Second Edition and noted several inaccuracies.</p>
			<p>In both editions the Introductions to the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Dialogues</i> have been enlarged, and essays on subjects having an affinity to the Platonic Dialogues have been introduced into several of them. The analyses have been corrected, and innumerable alterations have been made in the Text. There have been added also, in the Third Edition, headings to the pages and a marginal analysis to the text of each dialogue.</p>
			<p>At the end of a long task, the translator may without impropriety point out the difficulties which he has had to encounter. These have been far greater than he would have anticipated; nor is he at all sanguine that he has succeeded in overcoming them. Experience has made him feel that a translation, like a picture, is dependent for its effect on very minute touches; and that it is a work of infinite pains, to be returned to in many moods and viewed in different lights.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>. An English translation ought to be idiomatic and interesting, not only to the scholar, but to the unlearned reader. Its object should not simply be to render the words of one language into the words of another or to preserve the construction and order of the original;⁠—this is the ambition of a schoolboy, who wishes to show that he has made a good use of his Dictionary and Grammar; but is quite unworthy of the translator, who seeks to produce on his reader an impression similar or nearly similar to that produced by the original. To him the feeling should be more important than the exact word. He should remember Dryden’s quaint admonition not to “lackey by the side of his author, but to mount up behind him.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a> He must carry in his mind a comprehensive view of the whole work, of what has preceded and of what is to follow⁠—as well as of the meaning of particular passages. His version should be based, in the first instance, on an intimate knowledge of the text; but the precise order and arrangement of the words may be left to fade out of sight, when the translation begins to take shape. He must form a general idea of the two languages, and reduce the one to the terms of the other. His work should be rhythmical and varied, the right admixture of words and syllables, and even of letters, should be carefully attended to; above all, it should be equable in style. There must also be quantity, which is necessary in prose as well as in verse: clauses, sentences, paragraphs, must be in due proportion. Metre and even rhyme may be rarely admitted; though neither is a legitimate element of prose writing, they may help to lighten a cumbrous expression (compare “Symposium” <a href="symposium.xhtml#symposium-text-p-58">185 D</a>, <a href="symposium.xhtml#symposium-text-p-79">197</a>, <a href="symposium.xhtml#symposium-text-p-82">198</a>). The translation should retain as far as possible the characteristic qualities of the ancient writer⁠—his freedom, grace, simplicity, stateliness, weight, precision; or the best part of him will be lost to the English reader. It should read as an original work, and should also be the most faithful transcript which can be made of the language from which the translation is taken, consistently with the first requirement of all, that it be English. Further, the translation being English, it should also be perfectly intelligible in itself without reference to the Greek, the English being really the more lucid and exact of the two languages. In some respects it may be maintained that ordinary English writing, such as the newspaper article, is superior to Plato: at any rate it is couched in language which is very rarely obscure. On the other hand, the greatest writers of Greece, Thucydides, Plato, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Pindar, Demosthenes, are generally those which are found to be most difficult and to diverge most widely from the English idiom. The translator will often have to convert the more abstract Greek into the more concrete English, or vice versa, and he ought not to force upon one language the character of another. In some cases, where the order is confused, the expression feeble, the emphasis misplaced, or the sense somewhat faulty, he will not strive in his rendering to reproduce these characteristics, but will rewrite the passage as his author would have written it at first, had he not been “nodding”; and he will not hesitate to supply anything which, owing to the genius of the language or some accident of composition, is omitted in the Greek, but is necessary to make the English clear and consecutive.</p>
			<p>It is difficult to harmonize all these conflicting elements. In a translation of Plato what may be termed the interests of the Greek and English are often at war with one another. In framing the English sentence we are insensibly diverted from the exact meaning of the Greek; when we return to the Greek we are apt to cramp and overlay the English. We substitute, we compromise, we give and take, we add a little here and leave out a little there. The translator may sometimes be allowed to sacrifice minute accuracy for the sake of clearness and sense. But he is not therefore at liberty to omit words and turns of expression which the English language is quite capable of supplying. He must be patient and self-controlled; he must not be easily run away with. Let him never allow the attraction of a favourite expression, or a sonorous cadence, to overpower his better judgment, or think much of an ornament which is out of keeping with the general character of his work. He must ever be casting his eyes upwards from the copy to the original, and down again from the original to the copy (<a href="republic.xhtml#republic-book-6-p-227"><i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 501 A</a>). His calling is not held in much honour by the world of scholars; yet he himself may be excused for thinking it a kind of glory to have lived so many years in the companionship of one of the greatest of human intelligences, and in some degree, more perhaps than others, to have had the privilege of understanding him (compare Sir Joshua Reynolds’ Lectures: “Discourses” <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XV</span> <i xml:lang="la">sub <abbr>fin.</abbr></i>).</p>
			<p>There are fundamental differences in Greek and English, of which some may be managed while others remain intractable. (1). The structure of the Greek language is partly adversative and alternative, and partly inferential; that is to say, the members of a sentence are either opposed to one another, or one of them expresses the cause or effect or condition or reason of another. The two tendencies may be called the horizontal and perpendicular lines of the language; and the opposition or inference is often much more one of words than of ideas. But modern languages have rubbed off this adversative and inferential form: they have fewer links of connection, there is less mortar in the interstices, and they are content to place sentences side by side, leaving their relation to one another to be gathered from their position or from the context. The difficulty of preserving the effect of the Greek is increased by the want of adversative and inferential particles in English, and by the nice sense of tautology which characterizes all modern languages. We cannot have two “buts” or two “fors” in the same sentence where the Greek repeats <i xml:lang="grc">ἀλλὰ</i> or <i xml:lang="grc">γάρ</i>. There is a similar want of particles expressing the various gradations of objective and subjective thought⁠—<i xml:lang="grc">που</i>, <i xml:lang="grc">δὴ</i>, <i xml:lang="grc">μὴ</i>⁠–⁠, <i xml:lang="grc">μέντοι</i>, and the like, which are so thickly scattered over the Greek page. Further, we can only realize to a very imperfect degree the common distinction between <i xml:lang="grc">οὐ</i> and <i xml:lang="grc">μή</i>, and the combination of the two suggests a subtle shade of negation which cannot be expressed in English. And while English is more dependent than Greek upon the apposition of clauses and sentences, yet there is a difficulty in using this form of construction owing to the want of case endings. For the same reason there cannot be an equal variety in the order of words or an equal nicety of emphasis in English as in Greek.</p>
			<p>(2). The formation of the sentence and of the paragraph greatly differs in Greek and English. The lines by which they are divided are generally much more marked in modern languages than in ancient. Both sentences and paragraphs are more precise and definite⁠—they do not run into one another. They are also more regularly developed from within. The sentence marks another step in an argument or a narrative or a statement; in reading a paragraph we silently turn over the page and arrive at some new view or aspect of the subject. Whereas in Plato we are not always certain where a sentence begins and ends; and paragraphs are few and far between. The language is distributed in a different way, and less articulated than in English. For it was long before the true use of the period was attained by the classical writers both in poetry or prose; it was <i xml:lang="grc">πολλῆς πείρας τελευταῖον ἐπιγέννημα</i>. The balance of sentences and the introduction of paragraphs at suitable intervals must not be neglected if the harmony of the English language is to be preserved. And still a caution has to be added on the other side, that we must avoid giving it a numerical or mechanical character.</p>
			<p>(3). This, however, is not one of the greatest difficulties of the translator; much greater is that which arises from the restriction of the use of the genders. Men and women in English are masculine and feminine, and there is a similar distinction of sex in the words denoting animals; but all things else, whether outward objects or abstract ideas, are relegated to the class of neuters. Hardly in some flight of poetry do we ever endue any of them with the characteristics of a sentient being, and then only by speaking of them in the feminine gender. The virtues may be pictured in female forms, but they are not so described in language; a ship is humorously supposed to be the sailor’s bride; more doubtful are the personifications of church and country as females. Now the genius of the Greek language is the opposite of this. The same tendency to personification which is seen in the Greek mythology is common also in the language; and genders are attributed to things as well as persons according to their various degrees of strength and weakness; or from fanciful resemblances to the male or female form, or some analogy too subtle to be discovered. When the gender of any object was once fixed, a similar gender was naturally assigned to similar objects, or to words of similar formation. This use of genders in the denotation of objects or ideas not only affects the words to which genders are attributed, but the words with which they are construed or connected, and passes into the general character of the style. Hence arises a difficulty in translating Greek into English which cannot altogether be overcome. Shall we speak of the soul and its qualities, of virtue, power, wisdom, and the like, as feminine or neuter? The usage of the English language does not admit of the former, and yet the life and beauty of the style are impaired by the latter. Often the translator will have recourse to the repetition of the word, or to the ambiguous “they,” “their,” <abbr>etc.</abbr>; for fear of spoiling the effect of the sentence by introducing “it.” Collective nouns in Greek and English create a similar but lesser awkwardness.</p>
			<p>(4). To use of relation is far more extended in Greek than in English. Partly the greater variety of genders and cases makes the connection of relative and antecedent less ambiguous: partly also the greater number of demonstrative and relative pronouns, and the use of the article, make the correlation of ideas simpler and more natural. The Greek appears to have had an ear or intelligence for a long and complicated sentence which is rarely to be found in modern nations; and in order to bring the Greek down to the level of the modern, we must break up the long sentence into two or more short ones. Neither is the same precision required in Greek as in Latin or English, nor in earlier Greek as in later; there was nothing shocking to the contemporary of Thucydides and Plato in anacolutha and repetitions. In such cases the genius of the English language requires that the translation should be more intelligible than the Greek. The want of more distinctions between the demonstrative pronouns is also greatly felt. Two genitives dependent on one another, unless familiarised by idiom, have an awkward effect in English. Frequently the noun has to take the place of the pronoun. “This” and “that” are found repeating themselves to weariness in the rough draft of a translation. As in the previous case, while the feeling of the modern language is more opposed to tautology, there is also a greater difficulty in avoiding it.</p>
			<p>(5). Though no precise rule can be laid down about the repetition of words, there seems to be a kind of impertinence in presenting to the reader the same thought in the same words, repeated twice over in the same passage without any new aspect or modification of it. And the evasion of tautology⁠—that is, the substitution of one word of precisely the same meaning for another⁠—is resented by us equally with the repetition of words. Yet on the other hand the least difference of meaning or the least change of form from a substantive to an adjective, or from a participle to a verb, will often remedy the unpleasant effect. Rarely and only for the sake of emphasis or clearness can we allow an important word to be used twice over in two successive sentences or even in the same paragraph. The particles and pronouns, as they are of most frequent occurrence, are also the most troublesome. Strictly speaking, except a few of the commonest of them, “and,” “the,” <abbr>etc.</abbr>, they ought not to occur twice in the same sentence. But the Greek has no such precise rules; and hence any literal translation of a Greek author is full of tautology. The tendency of modern languages is to become more correct as well as more perspicuous than ancient. And, therefore, while the English translator is limited in the power of expressing relation or connection, by the law of his own language increased precision and also increased clearness are required of him. The familiar use of logic, and the progress of science, have in these two respects raised the standard. But modern languages, while they have become more exacting in their demands, are in many ways not so well furnished with powers of expression as the ancient classical ones.</p>
			<p>Such are a few of the difficulties which have to be overcome in the work of translation; and we are far from having exhausted the list. (6). The excellence of a translation will consist, not merely in the faithful rendering of words, or in the composition of a sentence only, or yet of a single paragraph, but in the colour and style of the whole work. Equability of tone is best attained by the exclusive use of familiar and idiomatic words. But great care must be taken; for an idiomatic phrase, if an exception to the general style, is of itself a disturbing element. No word, however expressive and exact, should be employed, which makes the reader stop to think, or unduly attracts attention by difficulty and peculiarity, or disturbs the effect of the surrounding language. In general the style of one author is not appropriate to another; as in society, so in letters, we expect every man to have “a good coat of his own,” and not to dress himself out in the rags of another. (a) Archaic expressions are therefore to be avoided. Equivalents may be occasionally drawn from Shakespeare, who is the common property of us all; but they must be used sparingly. For, like some other men of genius of the Elizabethan and Jacobean age, he outdid the capabilities of the language, and many of the expressions which he introduced have been laid aside and have dropped out of use. (b) A similar principle should be observed in the employment of Scripture. Having a greater force and beauty than other language, and a religious association, it disturbs the even flow of the style. It may be used to reproduce in the translation the quaint effect of some antique phrase in the original, but rarely; and when adopted, it should have a certain freshness and a suitable “entourage.” It is strange to observe that the most effective use of Scripture phraseology arises out of the application of it in a sense not intended by the author. (c) Another caution: metaphors differ in different languages, and the translator will often be compelled to substitute one for another, or to paraphrase them, not giving word for word, but diffusing over several words the more concentrated thought of the original. The Greek of Plato often goes beyond the English in its imagery: compare <a href="laws.xhtml#laws-book-3-tr-226"><i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Laws</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 695 C</a>, <i xml:lang="grc">ὧν καὶ νῦν ἔτι σμικρὰ ὀνείρατα λέλειπται</i>; <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i>, <a href="republic.xhtml#republic-book-1-p-287"><span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 345 E</a>; <a href="republic.xhtml#republic-book-9-p-358"><span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span> 588 C</a>, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> Or again the modern word, which in substance is the nearest equivalent to the Greek, may be found to include associations alien to Greek life: <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> <i xml:lang="grc">δικασταί</i>, “jurymen,” <i xml:lang="grc">τὰ μέσα τῶν πολιτῶν</i>, “the bourgeoisie.” (d) The translator has also to provide expressions for philosophical terms of very indefinite meaning in the more definite language of modern philosophy. And he must not allow discordant elements to enter into the work. For example, in translating Plato, it would equally be an anachronism to intrude on him the feeling and spirit of the Jewish or Christian Scriptures or the technical terms of the Hegelian or Darwinian philosophy.</p>
			<p>(7). As no two words are precise equivalents (just as no two leaves of the forest are exactly similar), it is a mistaken attempt at precision always to translate the same Greek word by the same English word. There is no reason why in the New Testament <i xml:lang="grc">δικαιοσύνη</i> should always be rendered “righteousness,” or <i xml:lang="grc">διαθήκη</i> “covenant.” In such cases the translator may be allowed to employ two words⁠—sometimes when the two meanings occur in the same passage, varying them by an “or”⁠—<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> <i xml:lang="grc">ἐπιστήμη</i>, “science” or “knowledge,” <i xml:lang="grc">εἶδος</i>, “idea” or “class,” <i xml:lang="grc">σωφροσύνη</i>, “temperance” or “prudence,”⁠—at the point where the change of meaning occurs. If translations are intended not for the Greek scholar but for the general reader, their worst fault will be that they sacrifice the general effect and meaning to the over-precise rendering of words and forms of speech.</p>
			<p>(8). There is no kind of literature in English which corresponds to the Greek Dialogue; nor is the English language easily adapted to it. The rapidity and abruptness of question and answer, the constant repetition of <i xml:lang="grc">ἧ δ’ ὅς</i>, <i xml:lang="grc">εἶπε</i>, <i xml:lang="grc">ἔφη</i>, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, which Cicero avoided in Latin (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">De amicitia</i> <abbr>c.</abbr> 1), the frequent occurrence of expletives, would, if reproduced in a translation, give offence to the reader. Greek has a freer and more frequent use of the Interrogative, and is of a more passionate and emotional character, and therefore lends itself with greater readiness to the dialogue form. Most of the so-called English Dialogues are but poor imitations of Plato, which fall very far short of the original. The breath of conversation, the subtle adjustment of question and answer, the lively play of fancy, the power of drawing characters, are wanting in them. But the Platonic dialogue is a drama as well as a dialogue, of which Socrates is the central figure, and there are lesser performers as well:⁠—the insolence of Thrasymachus, the anger of Callicles and Anytus, the patronizing style of Protagoras, the self-consciousness of Prodicus and Hippias, are all part of the entertainment. To reproduce this living image the same sort of effort is required as in translating poetry. The language, too, is of a finer quality; the mere prose English is slow in lending itself to the form of question and answer, and so the ease of conversation is lost, and at the same time the dialectical precision with which the steps of the argument are drawn out is apt to be impaired.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. In the Introductions to the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Dialogues</i> there have been added some essays on modern philosophy, and on political and social life. The chief subjects discussed in these are Utility, Communism, the Kantian and Hegelian philosophies, Psychology, and the Origin of Language.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a></p>
			<p>Ancient and modern philosophy throw a light upon one another: but they should be compared, not confounded. Although the connection between them is sometimes accidental, it is often real. The same questions are discussed by them under different conditions of language and civilization; but in some cases a mere word has survived, while nothing or hardly anything of the pre-Socratic, Platonic, or Aristotelian meaning is retained. There are other questions familiar to the moderns, which have no place in ancient philosophy. The world has grown older in two thousand years, and has enlarged its stock of ideas and methods of reasoning. Yet the germ of modern thought is found in ancient, and we may claim to have inherited, notwithstanding many accidents of time and place, the spirit of Greek philosophy. There is, however, no continuous growth of the one into the other, but a new beginning, partly artificial, partly arising out of the questionings of the mind itself, and also receiving a stimulus from the study of ancient writings.</p>
			<p>Considering the great and fundamental differences which exist in ancient and modern philosophy, it seems best that we should at first study them separately, and seek for the interpretation of either, especially of the ancient, from itself only, comparing the same author with himself and with his contemporaries, and with the general state of thought and feeling prevalent in his age. Afterwards comes the remoter light which they cast on one another. We begin to feel that the ancients had the same thoughts as ourselves, the same difficulties which characterize all periods of transition, almost the same opposition between science and religion. Although we cannot maintain that ancient and modern philosophy are one and continuous (as has been affirmed with more truth respecting ancient and modern history), for they are separated by an interval of a thousand years, yet they seem to recur in a sort of cycle, and we are surprised to find that the new is ever old, and that the teaching of the past has still a meaning for us.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. In the preface to the first edition I expressed a strong opinion at variance with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Grote’s, that the so-called Epistles of Plato were spurious. His friend and editor, Professor Bain, thinks that I ought to give the reasons why I differ from so eminent an authority. Reserving the fuller discussion of the question for another place, I will shortly defend my opinion by the following arguments:⁠—</p>
			<p>(a) Because almost all epistles purporting to be of the classical age of Greek literature are forgeries.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a> Of all documents this class are the least likely to be preserved and the most likely to be invented. The ancient world swarmed with them; the great libraries stimulated the demand for them; and at a time when there was no regular publication of books, they easily crept into the world.</p>
			<p>(b) When one epistle out of a number is spurious, the remainder of the series cannot be admitted to be genuine, unless there be some independent ground for thinking them so: when all but one are spurious, overwhelming evidence is required of the genuineness of the one: when they are all similar in style or motive, like witnesses who agree in the same tale, they stand or fall together. But no one, not even <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Grote, would maintain that all the Epistles of Plato are genuine, and very few critics think that more than one of them is so. And they are clearly all written from the same motive, whether serious or only literary. Nor is there an example in Greek antiquity of a series of Epistles, continuous and yet coinciding with a succession of events extending over a great number of years.</p>
			<p>The external probability therefore against them is enormous, and the internal probability is not less: for they are trivial and unmeaning, devoid of delicacy and subtlety, wanting in a single fine expression. And even if this be matter of dispute, there can be no dispute that there are found in them many plagiarisms, inappropriately borrowed, which is a common note of forgery. (compare 330 C following with <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i> <a href="republic.xhtml#republic-book-4-p-87"><span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 425 E</a>, <a href="republic.xhtml#republic-book-4-p-94">426 B</a>, <a href="republic.xhtml#republic-book-6-p-82"><span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 488 A</a>: 347 E with <a href="phaedrus.xhtml#phaedrus-text-p-31">“Phaedrus” 249 D</a>: 326 A, B and 328 A with <a href="republic.xhtml#republic-book-5-p-424"><i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 473 C, D <abbr>etc.</abbr></a>). They imitate Plato, who never imitates either himself or anyone else; reminiscences of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i> and the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Laws</i> are continually recurring in them; they are too like him and also too unlike him, to be genuine (see especially Karsten, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">Commentio critica de Platonis quae feruntur Epistolis</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 111 following). They are full of egotism, self-assertion, affectation, faults which of all writers Plato was most careful to avoid, and into which he was least likely to fall (<abbr>ibid.</abbr> <abbr>p.</abbr> 99 following). They abound in obscurities, irrelevancies, solecisms, pleonasms, inconsistencies (<abbr>ibid.</abbr> <abbr>p.</abbr> 96 following), awkwardnesses of construction, wrong uses of words (<abbr>ibid.</abbr> <abbr>pp.</abbr> 58, 59, 117, 121). They also contain historical blunders, such as the statement respecting Hipparinus and Nysaeus, the nephews of Dion (328 A), who are said to “have been well inclined to philosophy, and well able to dispose the mind of their brother Dionysius in the same course,” at a time when they could not have been more than six or seven years of age⁠—also foolish allusions, such as the comparison of the Athenian empire to the empire of Darius (332 A, B), which show a spirit very different from that of Plato; and mistakes of fact, as <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> about the Thirty Tyrants (<abbr>p.</abbr> 324 C), whom the writer of the letters seems to have confused with certain inferior magistrates, making them in all fifty-one. These palpable errors and absurdities are absolutely irreconcilable with their genuineness. And as they appear to have a common parentage, the more they are studied, the more they will be found to furnish evidence against themselves. The Seventh, which is thought to be the most important of these Epistles, has affinities with the Third and the Eighth, and is quite as impossible and inconsistent as the rest. It is therefore involved in the same condemnation.⁠—The final conclusion is that neither the Seventh nor any other of them, when carefully analyzed, can be imagined to have proceeded from the hand or mind of Plato. The other testimonies to the voyages of Plato to Sicily and the court of Dionysius are all of them later by several centuries than the events to which they refer. No extant writer mentions them older than Cicero and Cornelius Nepos. It does not seem impossible that so attractive a theme as the meeting of a philosopher and a tyrant, once imagined by the genius of a Sophist, may have passed into a romance which became famous in Hellas and the world. It may have created one of the mists of history, like the Trojan war or the legend of Arthur, which we are unable to penetrate. In the age of Cicero, and still more in that of Diogenes Laertius and Appuleius, many other legends had gathered around the personality of Plato⁠—more voyages, more journeys to visit tyrants and Pythagorean philosophers. But if, as we agree with Karsten in supposing, they are the forgery of some rhetorician or sophist, we cannot agree with him in also supposing that they are of any historical value, the rather as there is no early independent testimony by which they are supported or with which they can be compared.</p>

There is another subject to which I must briefly call attention, lest I should seem to have overlooked it. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Henry Jackson, of Trinity College, Cambridge, in a series of articles which he has contributed to the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Journal of Philology</i> (1881⁠–⁠6; <abbr>Vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span> 132⁠–⁠150, 253⁠–⁠293; <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span> 287⁠–⁠331; <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIII</span> 1⁠–⁠40; <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIV</span> 173⁠–⁠230, extending to about 200 pages), has put forward an entirely new explanation of the Platonic “Ideas.” He supposes that in the mind of Plato they took, at different times in his life, two essentially different forms:⁠—an earlier one which is found chiefly in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i> and the “Phaedo,” and a later, which appears in the “Theaetetus,” “Philebus,” “Sophist,” “Politicus,” “Parmenides,” “Timaeus.” In the first stage of his philosophy Plato attributed Ideas to all things, at any rate to all things which have classes or common notions: these he supposed to exist only by participation in them. In the later Dialogues he no longer included in them manufactured articles and ideas of relation, but restricted them to “types of nature,” and having become convinced that the many cannot be parts of the one, for the idea of participation in them he substituted imitation of them (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span> 292). To quote <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Jackson’s own expressions (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span> 297)⁠—“whereas in the period of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i> and the ‘Phaedo,’ it was proposed to pass through ontology to the sciences, in the period of the ‘Parmenides’ and the ‘Philebus,’ it is proposed to pass through the sciences to ontology”: or, as he repeats in nearly the same words (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span> 320)⁠—“whereas in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i> and in the ‘Phaedo’ he had dreamt of passing through ontology to the sciences, he is now content to pass through the sciences to ontology.”</p>
			<p>This theory is supposed to be based on Aristotle’s “Metaphysics” (Book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> <abbr>c.</abbr> 6), a passage containing an account of the ideas, which hitherto scholars have found impossible to reconcile with the statements of Plato himself. The preparations for the new departure are discovered in the “Parmenides” and in the “Theaetetus”; and it is said to be expressed under a different form by the <i xml:lang="grc">πέρας</i> and the <i xml:lang="grc">ἄπειρον</i> of the “Philebus” (<abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span> 275 following). The <i xml:lang="grc">πέρας</i> of the “Philebus” is the principle which gives form and measure to the <i xml:lang="grc">ἄπειρον</i>; and in the “Later Theory” is held to be the <i xml:lang="grc">πόσον</i> or <i xml:lang="grc">μέτριον</i> which converts the Infinite or Indefinite into ideas. They are neither <i xml:lang="grc">περαίνοντα</i> nor <i xml:lang="grc">ἄπειρα</i>, but belong to the <i xml:lang="grc">μικτὸν γένος</i> which partakes of both.</p>
			<p>With great respect for the learning and ability of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Jackson, I find myself unable to agree in this newly fashioned doctrine of the Ideas, which he ascribes to Plato. I have not the space to go into the question fully; but I will briefly state some objections which are, I think, fatal to it.</p>
			<p>(1). First, the foundation of his argument is laid in the “Metaphysics” of Aristotle. But we cannot argue, either from the “Metaphysics,” or from any other of the philosophical treatises of Aristotle, to the dialogues of Plato until we have ascertained the relation in which his so-called works stand to the philosopher himself. There is of course no doubt of the great influence exercised upon Greece and upon the world by Aristotle and his philosophy. But on the other hand almost everyone who is capable of understanding the subject acknowledges that his writings have not come down to us in an authentic form like most of the dialogues of Plato. How much of them is to be ascribed to Aristotle’s own hand, how much is due to his successors in the Peripatetic School, is a question which has never been determined, and probably never can be, because the solution of it depends upon internal evidence only. To “the height of this great argument” I do not propose to ascend. But one little fact, not irrelevant to the present discussion, will show how hopeless is the attempt to explain Plato out of the writings of Aristotle. In the chapter of the Metaphysics quoted by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Jackson (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 6), about two octavo pages in length, there occur no less than seven or eight references to Plato, although nothing really corresponding to them can be found in his extant writings:⁠—a small matter truly; but what a light does it throw on the character of the entire book in which they occur! We can hardly escape from the conclusion that they are not statements of Aristotle respecting Plato, but of a later generation of Aristotelians respecting a later generation of Platonists.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a></p>
			<p>(2). There is no hint in Plato’s own writings that he was conscious of having made any change in the Doctrine of Ideas such as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Jackson attributes to him, although in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i> the platonic Socrates speaks of “a longer and a shorter way” (<a href="republic.xhtml#republic-book-4-p-258"><span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 435</a>; <a href="republic.xhtml#republic-book-6-p-277"><span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 504</a>), and of a way in which his disciple Glaucon “will be unable to follow him” (<a href="republic.xhtml#republic-book-7-p-259"><span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span> 533</a>); also of a way of Ideas, to which he still holds fast, although it has often deserted him (<a href="philebus.xhtml#philebus-text-tr-62">“Philebus” 16 C</a>, <a href="phaedo.xhtml#phaedo-text-p-474">“Phaedo” 97⁠–⁠108</a>), and although in the later dialogues and in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Laws</i> the reference to Ideas disappears, and Mind claims her own (“Philebus” <a href="philebus.xhtml#philebus-text-tr-325">31</a>, <a href="philebus.xhtml#philebus-text-tr-1099">65</a>; <a href="laws.xhtml#laws-book-12-tr-72"><i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Laws</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span> 965 B</a>). No hint is given of what Plato meant by the “longer way” (<a href="republic.xhtml#republic-book-4-p-270"><i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 435 D</a>), or “the way in which Glaucon was unable to follow” (<a href="republic.xhtml#republic-book-7-p-259"><abbr>ibid.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span> 533 A</a>); or of the relation of Mind to the Ideas. It might be said with truth that the conception of the Idea predominates in the first half of the Dialogues, which, according to the order adopted in this work, ends with the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i>, the “conception of Mind” and a way of speaking more in agreement with modern terminology, in the latter half. But there is no reason to suppose that Plato’s theory, or, rather, his various theories, of the Ideas underwent any definite change during his period of authorship. They are substantially the same in the twelfth Book of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Laws</i> (<a href="laws.xhtml#laws-book-12-tr-29">962</a>, <a href="laws.xhtml#laws-book-12-tr-42">963 following</a>) as in the “Meno” and “Phaedo”; and since the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Laws</i> were written in the last decade of his life, there is no time to which this change of opinions can be ascribed. It is true that the theory of Ideas takes several different forms, not merely an earlier and a later one, in the various Dialogues. They are personal and impersonal, ideals and ideas, existing by participation or by imitation, one and many, in different parts of his writings or even in the same passage (compare <a href="meno.xhtml#on-the-ideas-of-plato">On the Ideas of Plato</a>). They are the universal definitions of Socrates, and at the same time “of more than mortal knowledge” (<a href="republic.xhtml#republic-book-6-p-14"><i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 485</a>). But they are always the negations of sense, of matter, of generation, of the particular: they are always the subjects of knowledge and not of opinion; and they tend, not to diversity, but to unity. Other entities or intelligences are akin to them, but not the same with them, such as mind, measure, limit, eternity, essence (compare “Philebus” <i xml:lang="la">sub <abbr>fin.</abbr></i>; “Timaeus” passim): these and similar terms appear to express the same truths from a different point of view, and to belong to the same sphere with them. But we are not justified, therefore, in attempting to identify them, any more than in wholly opposing them. The great oppositions of the sensible and intellectual, the unchangeable and the transient, in whatever form of words expressed, are always maintained in Plato. But the lesser logical distinctions, as we should call them, whether of ontology or predication, which troubled the pre-Socratic philosophy and came to the front in Aristotle, are variously discussed and explained. Thus far we admit inconsistency in Plato, but no further. He lived in an age before logic and system had wholly permeated language, and therefore we must not always expect to find in him systematic arrangement or logical precision:⁠—<i xml:lang="la">poema magis putandum.</i> But he is always true to his own context, the careful study of which is of more value to the interpreter than all the commentators and scholiasts put together.</p>
			<p>(3). The conclusions at which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Jackson has arrived are such as might be expected to follow from his method of procedure. For he takes words without regard to their connection, and pieces together different parts of dialogues in a purely arbitrary manner, although there is no indication that the author intended the two passages to be so combined, or that when he appears to be experimenting on the different points of view from which a subject of philosophy may be regarded, he is secretly elaborating a system. By such a use of language any premises may be made to lead to any conclusion. I am not one of those who believe Plato to have been a mystic or to have had hidden meanings; nor do I agree with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Jackson in thinking that “when he is precise and dogmatic, he generally contrives to introduce an element of obscurity into the expostion” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Journal of Philology</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span> 150). The great master of language wrote as clearly as he could in an age when the minds of men were clouded by controversy, and philosophical terms had not yet acquired a fixed meaning. I have just said that Plato is to be interpreted by his context; and I do not deny that in some passages, especially in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Laws</i>, the context is at a greater distance than would be allowable in a modern writer. But we are not therefore justified in connecting passages from different parts of his writings, or even from the same work, which he has not himself joined. We cannot argue from the “Parmenides” to the “Philebus,” or from either to the “Sophist,” or assume that the “Parmenides,” the “Philebus,” and the “Timaeus” were “written simultaneously,” or “were intended to be studied in the order in which they are here named” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Journal of Philology</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIII</span> 38)) We have no right to connect statements which are only accidentally similar. Nor is it safe for the author of a theory about ancient philosophy to argue from what will happen if his statements are rejected. For those consequences may never have entered into the mind of the ancient writer himself; and they are very likely to be modern consequences which would not have been understood by him. “I cannot think,” says <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Jackson, “that Plato would have changed his opinions, but have nowhere explained the nature of the change.” But is it not much more improbable that he should have changed his opinions, and not stated in an unmistakable manner that the most essential principle of his philosophy had been reversed? It is true that a few of the dialogues, such as the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i> and the “Timaeus,” or the “Theaetetus” and the “Sophist,” or the “Meno” and the “Apology,” contain allusions to one another. But these allusions are superficial and, except in the case of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i> and the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Laws</i>, have no philosophical importance. They do not affect the substance of the work. It may be remarked further that several of the dialogues, such as the “Phaedrus,” the “Sophist,” and the “Parmenides,” have more than one subject. But it does not therefore follow that Plato intended one dialogue to succeed another, or that he begins anew in one dialogue a subject which he has left unfinished in another, or that even in the same dialogue he always intended the two parts to be connected with each other. We cannot argue from a casual statement found in the “Parmenides” to other statements which occur in the “Philebus.” Much more truly is his own manner described by himself when he says that “words are more plastic than wax” (<a href="republic.xhtml#republic-book-9-p-358"><i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span> 588 C</a>), and “whither the wind blows, the argument follows” (<a href="republic.xhtml#republic-book-3-p-156"><abbr>ibid.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 394 D</a>). The dialogues of Plato are like poems, isolated and separate works, except where they are indicated by the author himself to have an intentional sequence.</p>
			<p>It is this method of taking passages out of their context and placing them in a new connection when they seem to confirm a preconceived theory, which is the defect of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Jackson’s procedure. It may be compared, though not wholly the same with it, to that method which the Fathers practised, sometimes called “the mystical interpretation of Scripture,” in which isolated words are separated from their context, and receive any sense which the fancy of the interpreter may suggest. It is akin to the method employed by Schleiermacher of arranging the dialogues of Plato in chronological order according to what he deems the true arrangement of the ideas contained in them. (<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Jackson is also inclined, having constructed a theory, to make the chronology of Plato’s writings dependent upon it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a>) It may likewise be illustrated by the ingenuity of those who employ symbols to find in Shakespeare a hidden meaning. In the three cases the error is nearly the same:⁠—words are taken out of their natural context, and thus become destitute of any real meaning.</p>
			<p>(4). According to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Jackson’s “Later Theory,” Plato’s Ideas, which were once regarded as the summa genera of all things, are now to be explained as Forms or Types of some things only⁠—;that is to say, of natural objects: these we conceive imperfectly, but are always seeking in vain to have a more perfect notion of them. He says (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Journal of Philology</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span> 319) that “Plato hoped by the study of a series of hypothetical or provisional classifications to arrive at one in which nature’s distribution of kinds is approximately represented, and so to attain approximately to the knowledge of the ideas. But whereas in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Republic</i>, and even in the ‘Phaedo,’ though less hopefully, he had sought to convert his provisional definitions into final ones by tracing their connection with the summum genus, the <i xml:lang="grc">ἀγαθόν</i>, in the ‘Parmenides’ his aspirations are less ambitious,” and so on. But where does <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Jackson find any such notion as this in Plato or anywhere in ancient philosophy? Is it not an anachronism, gracious to the modern physical philosopher, and the more acceptable because it seems to form a link between ancient and modern philosophy, and between physical and metaphysical science; but really unmeaning?</p>
			<p>(5). To this “Later Theory” of Plato’s Ideas I oppose the authority of Professor Zeller, who affirms that none of the passages to which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Jackson appeals (<a href="theaetetus.xhtml#theaetetus-text-tr-524">“Theaetetus” 185 C following</a>; <a href="philebus.xhtml#philebus-text-tr-197">“Philebus” 25 B following</a>; <a href="timaeus.xhtml#timaeus-text-p-81">“Timaeus” 57 C</a>; <a href="parmenides.xhtml#parmenides-text-p-19">“Parmenides” 130 B following</a>, <a href="parmenides.xhtml#parmenides-text-p-350">142 B⁠–⁠155 E</a>, <a href="parmenides.xhtml#parmenides-text-p-868">157 B⁠–⁠159 E</a>) “in the smallest degree prove his point”; and that in the second class of dialogues, in which the “Later Theory of Ideas” is supposed to be found, quite as clearly as in the first, are admitted Ideas, not only of natural objects, but of properties, relations, works of art, negative notions (<a href="theaetetus.xhtml#theaetetus-text-tr-423">“Theaetetus” 176 E</a>; <a href="parmenides.xhtml#parmenides-text-p-19">“Parmenides” 130 B following</a>; <a href="sophist.xhtml#sophist-text-tr-817">“Sophist” 254 B following</a>, <a href="sophist.xhtml#sophist-text-tr-939">258 B</a>); and that what <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Jackson distinguishes as the first class of dialogues from the second equally assert or imply that the relation of things to the Ideas, is one of participation in them as well as of imitation of them (<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Prof.</abbr> Zeller’s summary of his own review of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Jackson, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal" xml:lang="de">Archiv für Geschichte der Philosophie</i>, <abbr>Vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>, Berlin, 1888, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 617, 618.)</p>
			<p>In conclusion I may remark that in Plato’s writings there is both unity, and also growth and development; but that we must not intrude upon him either a system or a technical language.</p>
